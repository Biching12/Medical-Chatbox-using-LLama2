Normally, the liver processes the bilirubinand excretes it in the stool. Hyperbilirubinemia meansthere is a high level of bilirubin in the blood. This con-dition is particularly common in newborn infants.Before birth, an infant gets rid of bilirubin through themother’s blood and liver systems. After birth, thebaby’s liver has to take over processing bilirubin on itsown. Almost all newborns have higher than normal lev-els of bilirubin.

Neutrophils are white blood cells(WBCs) produced in the bone marrow that ingest bacte-ria. Neutropenia is sometimes called agranulocytosis orgranulocytopenia because neutrophils make up about60% of WBCs and have granules inside their cell walls.Neutropenia is a serious disorder because it makes thebody vulnerable to bacterial and fungal infections.\\nDescription\\nThe normal level of neutrophils in human blood\\nvaries slightly by age and race. Infants have lower countsthan older children and adults, and African Americanshave lower counts than Caucasians or Asians. The aver-age adult level is 1500 cells/mm\\n3of blood. Neutrophil\\ncounts (in cells/mm3) are interpreted as follows:\\n• greater than 1000. Normal protection against infection.\\n• 500–1000. Some increased risk of infection.• 200–500. Great risk of severe infection.• lower than 200. Risk of overwhelming infection; requires'}),\n",

When the placenta attaches to\\nthe mouth of the uterus and partially or completelyblocks the cervix, the position is termed placenta previa\\n(or low-lying placenta). Placenta previa can result in\\npremature bleeding and possible postpartum hemor-rhage.\\nPREECLAMPSIA/ECLAMPSIA. Preeclampsia (tox-\\nemia), or pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, causessevere edema (swelling due to water retention) and can\\nimpair kidney and liver function. The condition occurs inapproximately 5% of all United States pregnancies. If itprogresses to eclampsia, toxemia is potentially fatal formother and child.\\nPREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES (PROM).\\nPremature rupture of membranes is the breaking of\\nthe bag of waters (amniotic fluid) before contractions orlabor begins. The situation is only considered an emer-gency if the break occurs before thirty-seven weeks andresults in significant leakage of amniotic fluid and/orinfection of the amniotic sac.\\nObstetrical emergencies during labor and delivery'}),\n",

A healthy pancreas isimportant for normal food digestion and plays a criticalrole in the body’s metabolic processes. The pancreas hastwo main functions, each performed by distinct types oftissue. The exocrine tissue secretes fluids into the otherorgans of the digestive system, while the endocrine tissuesecretes substances that are circulated in the bloodstream.The exocrine pancreas makes up the vast majority of thegland; it produces pancreatic juices containing enzymesthat help break down proteins and fatty food. Theendocrine tissue of the pancreas makes up only 2% of thegland’s total mass.
